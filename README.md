# MyAppPortfolio
This is my first simple app that i developed when i started my udacity journey. The main idea of the app was the outline the apps that
would have to be built to earn a udacity advanced android certification. 

I learned alot when developing this seemily simple project because,
i had never developed anything before it. 


The application contains basic information about varies of udacity projects that would be generated over a several months to 
increase proficiency in android development and learn far beyond the fundamentals of android development and
skills needed to work as a java developer for the android platform.
